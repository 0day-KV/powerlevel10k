# Powerlevel10k

Powerlevel10k is a theme for ZSH. It's a backward-compatible fork of
[Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) with lower latency and better
prompt responsiveness.

If you like the look and feel of Powerlevel9k but feeling frustrated by the
slow prompt, simply replace your `powerlevel9k` theme with `powerlevel10k` and
enjoy responsive shell like it's 80's again!

Powerlevel10k uses the same configuration options as Powerlevel9k and produces the
same results. It's simply faster. There is no catch.

** Do not load both Powerlevel9k and Powerlevel10k themes at the same time. Variable name
clashes will cause mayhem. Source either one or the other. Consider Powerlevel10k
a patched fork of Powerlevel9k, which it is.**

For installation and configuration instructions, see
[Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k). Everything in there applies to
Powerlevel10k as well.

If you are on Linux or WSL, consider enabling [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus)
plugin for massive performance improvement in vcs/prompt segment. It works well with Powerlevel10k.
